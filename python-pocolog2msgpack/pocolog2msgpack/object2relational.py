def object2relational(input_filename, output_filename, whitelist=()):
    """Convert a MsgPack logfile from object-oriented to relational storage.

    The log data produced by pocolog2msgpack can usually be accessed with
    log[port_name][sample_idx][field_a]...[field_b]. This is an
    object-oriented view of the data because you can easily access a whole
    object from the log. This is not convenient if you want to use the data
    for, e.g., machine learning, where you typically need the whole dataset
    in a 2D array, i.e. a relational view on the data, in which you can
    access data in the form log[port_name][feature][sample_idx].

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_filename : str
        Name of the original logfile

    output_filename : str
        Name of the converted logfile

    whitelist : list or tuple
        Usually arrays and vectors (represented as lists in Python) are handled
        as basic types and are put in a single column because they can have
        dynamic sizes. This is a list of fields that will be scanned
        recursively and interpreted as arrays with a fixed length. Note that
        you only have to give the name of the field, not the port name.
        An example would be ["elements", "names"] if you want fully unravel
        a JointState object.
